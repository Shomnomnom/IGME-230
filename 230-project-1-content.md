## Story:
The last thing you can remember is hiking with your friends in the mountains when suddenly you fell through an opening in the rocks. 
Confused and injured, you soon find yourself in a life-or-death situation as you are surrounded by twisted flesh-hungry monstrosities. 
You won't simply die without a fight, hope is not lost as around you lie the tools of those who fell victim before you. Put them to better
use than their previous owners lest you join them as a permanent resident of the dark.

## Visuals:
The graphics will take after the art style of Darkest Dungeon. Gritty and detailed with dark colors and lighting.

## Audio:
Most audio will be atmospheric such as rustling sounds, quiet whispers, and various audio cues.

## Gameplay:
The game is played by using the mouse to navigate between areas of a small map. In each area they will be able to search for useful items left behind by 
people who had escaped (or died) in the cave. Certain items will provide certain benefits towards making your escape but may also make you
more noticeable by the creatures after your life. If found by a creature you can use the items you found to either attempt to fight and keep your progress
towards the exit or run and lose some progress in order to protect your life.

The player will be taught how to play the game through on-screen text prompts in the form of narration. This will be somewhat similar to 
Oregon Trail. There will also be audio cues that there may be a creature nearby or sounds that may indicate you are nearing escape. These may 
be used to trick the player by using slightly different audio cues.
